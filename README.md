# Education, Partisan Alignment, and Early Life Adversity

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data preparation scripts used in the analysis presented in the paper "Education, Partisan Alignment, and Early Life Adversity" by Eduardo Fé. The study examines the causal effect of education on political alignment and engagement using a randomization-based Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design (FRDD). The paper exploits the 1972 increase in the U.K. school leaving age from 15 to 16 to estimate the long-term effects of education on political alignment, using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (HLS) and the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS).

## Requirements

To run the code, you need:

Stata 15+ (for running .do files)
You will need to install the rdrandinf package by Matias Cattaneo and co-authors. As of 10th of March 2025 I recommend to download this directly from Matias Cattaneo's own website, as the code in the Stata server seems to have some bugs.
